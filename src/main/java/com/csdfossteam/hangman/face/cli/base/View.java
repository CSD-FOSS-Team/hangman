 * A text interface with placeholder for values.

 * The format of the based string follows the next rules:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A placeholder is declared by the name of the value that will be placed
 * wrapped around the characters { and }.
 * <li>If there is any whitespace before the start of the name of the value, it
 * will be aligned to the right.
 * <li>If there is any whitespace after the end of the name of the value, it
 * will be aligned to the left.
 * <li>If there is any whitespace before and after the name of the value, it
 * will be aligned to the center (<b>not implemented yet<b>).
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Name: {name             }
 * Age:  {   age} years old
 * </pre>
